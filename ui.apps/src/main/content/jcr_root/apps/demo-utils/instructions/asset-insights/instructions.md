## Performance data

This package automatically generates random Performance data for Clicks and Impressions. 

![Asset Insights - Performance](./asset-insights/images/performance.png)

The performance data is displayed in the graph at the bottom of any Asset's **Properties > Insights tab**. Performance data is generated automatically when this package is installed and does not require any other special activity (such as executing a Workflow) to take place.

## Usage and Summary data

This package provides a Workflow model that generates random Asset Insights Usage and Summary data for all assets in a folder (or sub-folders).

![Asset Insights - Score and Usage](./asset-insights/images/score-and-usage.png)

To generate Asset Insights Usage and Summary data, the **Generate Asset Insights Usage Data** must be executed against an Assets Folder.

1. Go to <a href="/assets.html/content/dam" target="_blank">Assets > Files</a> and select an Assets folder whose assets should have generated Usage and Summary data applied.
2. Select an Assets folder to apply the simulate Asset Insights data to.
3. In the top-left, tap **Create > Workflow**
5. Select **Generate Asset Insights Usage Data**
6. Tap **Start**
7. Open the Properties for any asset in the processed folder (or in any sub-folders)
8. Navigate to the Insights tab and the mock Summary and Usage data is visible
