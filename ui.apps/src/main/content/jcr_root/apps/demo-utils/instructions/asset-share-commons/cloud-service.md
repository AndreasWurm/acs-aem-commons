Asset Share Commons is included as part of the All Demos project that can be deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service environments via Cloud Manager.

By virtue of having Demo Utils installed on AEM as a Cloud Service, means that Asset Share Commons is also installed.

### AEM as a Cloud Service incompatibilities

The bulk of Asset Share Commons works on AEM as a Cloud Service, however the following features may need to be implemented on a per-project basis to meet AEM as a Cloud  Services best practices:

* Asset download via zip file
* Asset sharing via e-mail
