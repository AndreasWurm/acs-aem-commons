360-degree videos, also known as spherical videos are video recordings where a view in every direction is recorded at the same time, shot using an omnidirectional camera or collection of cameras. During playback on a flat display the user has control of the viewing direction, and playback on mobile devices typically leverage built in gyroscope control.

360 Video can be delivered using standard video extensions like .mp4, .mkv, .mov. The most common codec is H.264.

Dynamic Media provides processing of the video asset and special viewers that allow end-user to interact (pan, rotate, etc.) with the 360/VR video.
