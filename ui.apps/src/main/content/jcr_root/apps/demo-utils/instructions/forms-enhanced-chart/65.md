# Multi Series Charts in AEM Forms

### Setting up the demo assets

> Ensure that you have completed the steps to [install the Forms Add on](/apps/demo-utils/instructions/forms.html) **before** proceeding.

1. Download and unzip  the following file on your operating system:
	* <a href="https://link.enablementadobe.com/forms-multi-charts" class="button" target="_blank">MultiSeriesChartsDemoAssets.zip</a>

2. Open <a href="/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments" target="_blank">Forms And Documents</a>
3. Click **Create** > **File Upload**
4. From the unzipped file, upload: **MultiSeriesChart.zip**. This contains the Interactive Communication Print Channel Document

### Demonstrating Multi Series Charts

1. Navigate to <a href="/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments" target="_blank">Forms and Documents</a>
2. Select the Mutual Fund Fact Sheet Interactive Communication
3. Click **Preview** > **Upload Sample Data** 
4. Select the **SampleDataForMultiSeriesCharts.json**. This file was included in the MultiSeriesChartsDemoAssets.zip file which you unzipped in the earlier step
5. Mutual Fund Fact Sheet with Multi Series Charts should get displayed
6. The data for the charts is coming from the data file you uploaded in step 2

### Talking Points

* Enhanced charting capabilities.
* AEM Forms 6.5 now supports wide range of charts- Line,Bar,Column,Pie,Area,MultiSeries,Quadrant etc
* The data for the charts can be fetched dynamically using Form Data Model
* Ideal for Financial Services customers wanting to generate complex documents such as Mutual Fund Fact Sheet, Mutual Fund prospectus etc.
* The same assets used in generating print channel document can be used in generating web channel document
