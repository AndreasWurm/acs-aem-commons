AEM Core Components are a set of standardized components for AEM that can be used to speed up development of websites.

* Open source and hosted publically on GitHub: [https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components)
* Core Components Road map is public at: [https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/wiki](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/wiki)

The AEM Sites Core Component Showcase is a build out of ficticious web sites, each web site comprised of 3 mocked up page types, using only Core Components (or as it turns only, MOSTLY Core Components).

The sites are built using AEM's latest technologies:

* Core Components
* Style System
* Editable Templates
* Responsive Grid
* NPM ClientLibrary Module

..and each page is configured to be responsive to Desktop, Tablet and Mobile views.

## Value proposition

The Core Component Showcase sites demonstrate real-life build out of website designs using mostly Core Components, and front-end development work (CSS and JavaScript) to style the Core Components to attain these varying designs.

Targeting Core Components' stable HTML structure and consistent CSS class naming, front-end developers can use tools they know and love (we used **Webpack** and **SCSS**) to skin and style Core Components to meet most design requirements.

It's worth noting that the front-end assets were developed using the usual, AEM-agnostic front-end development tools:

* Node/NPM Modules
* Webpack
* SCSS
* Babel

The community-provided AEM ClientLibrary NPM Module was used to build this front-end project and automatically package and deploy it as an AEM ClientLibrary.
