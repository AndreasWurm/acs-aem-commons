## Online Cloud Manager Demo

The "real" Cloud Manager UI can be show shown for demos. The major caveat when demoing Cloud Manager is many operations, including:

+ Provisioning new Programs
+ Creating new Environments
+ Executing Pipelines and Deploying to AEM as a Cloud Service

.. can take 15 - 60 mins each, to complete. Be aware of these time constraints as and position the demo execution to accommodate if you choose to demonstrate Cloud Manager perform real work.

Offline Cloud Manager, provided below, is a local facade of Cloud Manager that shows the various interactions in accelerated time, with the caveat it is all simulated and does not do anything.

The OMC Cloud Manager does not perform the underlying actions, and not all functions in Cloud Manager work, so familiarize yourself with it prior to demoing
